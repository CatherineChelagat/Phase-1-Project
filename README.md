>Should Microsoft venture in domestic or foreign production, or both? What movie titles would be best for either?

>Toy Story 3 has the lowest foreign gross income but highest domestic income, while Shrek Forever After has the lowest domestic income but the highest foreign income. Therefore, as Microsoft looks into movies to emulate, they should pay attention to whether they are looking to satisfy the foreign or domestic market. This will address the question on which option will earn them the most income.

# Conclusions
>Adventure, animation and comedy, as a combined category are the highest rated genres. History is the lowest rated. Drama and Biography category also have quite the high average rating.

>When it comes to runtime, movies with a higher runtime have a higher average rating. Adventure, animation, and comedy category is however an exception to the rule. This category has the lowest runtime but still gets the highest average rating.

>Movies that perform well in the domestic market, perform poorly in foreign markets, i.e Toy Story 3 and Shrek Forever After.

# Recommendations
>Microsoft should base their video on adventure, animation and comedy since these genres are doing better than the rest in terms of average ratings. They can decide to have a low or high runtime, this variable is not very significant in determining the performance of movies in those specific genres.

>Should Microsoft wish to incorporate genre to their choice, they should select from genres with a high runtime since they have a higher average rating.

>For starters Microsoft should focus on movie types that do well in the domestic market before proceeding to those that do well in foreign markets.
